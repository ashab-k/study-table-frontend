                  First, where students take a particular lecture or class.
                  Where a teacher explains a topic and important concepts.
                  Second, part of the learning happens when a student goes out
                  of the class. When he reads by himself and solves a question.
                  While both parts are necessary but it is the second part that
                  matters the most. Our product is for that second part.

Revision and Reassuring : In General, A student opens a Book or sheet by a coaching institute or a question bank book to start reading the concept and do practice from them. There are some good books. Similarly there are good question bank and coaching material. Every student starts from the beginning and travels as he or she flips the pages.",

Few theoretical part can only be understood unless prior theory has been understood completely and that comes only when you have practice it enough. This is critical in learning as the students mental state gets affected and it is such mental states compounded over the years that results in a better or worse student. These minor events creates a huge difference in overall performance of a student over the year. Now imagine someone is sitting right by the side of student at his private study hour. That someone knows the book, syllabus and its every details of it. And he give a page to the student for the immediate study. He watches the student carefully while the learning process goes on. And when it ends he hands over another sheet. Then the student learns this one. Again, at the end of the sesion that someone analyzes all the previous sessions and gives the student another sheet. And the process continues like thatâ€¦Crafting the learning process. When and what to read. When and what question to solve. We do this.",

This process is very emotional. Many student see the solution and makes up his mind whether it is easy or hard. Whether he will be able to do the question next time or not. Learning is hard. And anyone who says he learns easy is basically a lie. It takes rigorous training in that particular subject for hours or month that makes a student or a person intuitive enough or smart enough to tackle the question easily or understand that concept. It is also that rigourous moment where the difference occurs. It is very emotional and affects a student psychologically for the subject and the study in general.",

That sheet contains only that concept that needed to be applied to that particular question. That sheet contains only that concept that will help the student to understand the article he is reading. And once the student is done, he takes away the smaller sheet and walks him back to the question or article he was engaged with. Mr. B is different than a human teacher. He never gets frustrated. He never gets bored. He got all the time for that student only. The student feels slight tough, as learning is tough, but he never gets frustrated as a whole. He never goes anywhere else or looks for any alternative. He gets all the help he need by Mr. B. We do this.",

                  Now imagine if we can create an assessment after fixed number

                  number of hours will determine when he gets one. What topic of
                  assessment that needs to be done. Remember Mr. B was at the
                  table. He knows where the problem was faced earlier and hence
                  how a assessment should be created to test whether that
                  concept is learned and understood or not! Mr. B has no other
                  thing to do except thinking about that student. So he hands
                  over the test result immediately. We create specific
                  assessment for that student. Assessment happens whenever a
                  student has studied enough that can clutter his thought and he
                  needs an assessment. We do all that.

                  "There is a context of learning and students have some exam to crack. Students constantly need to check whether they are meeting the demands of the exam or not!",
                  "This is mostly done by none. Only few students do make charts and plan for themselves. Most of them just follow school and college framework. This gets highly unmanaged. This is the reason why 60% student quit their preparation by the time they reach 12th standard for JEE or NEET. Another 20% also shift to boards six months before the exam. They start going on zig zag path and it is this mis management at this time which effects their outcome hugely. Now imagine if we keep tracking the exam requirement from the beginning. Keep proritizing the study show that minimum is always insured. Students, based on their number of hour and capacity, gets their own particular plan. Imagine while we teaching we expose them with the questions and study in a way that consecutively takes care of exam. Since now they do not need to worry for the minimum they can remain calm and feel more confident. No one knows what could be the highest height but we can, for sure, constrained the minimum threshold height. And when there is this level of management they will do wonders. We do wonders.",
